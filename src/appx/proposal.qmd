    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Our project will analyze historical stock market fluctuations from 2000-2025, examining how major economic, political, and global events impact market volatility across different sectors. We'll collect and analyze comprehensive market data to identify patterns that precede significant market movements and evaluate the effectiveness of various prediction models in anticipating market corrections and rallies.

    <h2>Motivation and Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      Our team selected this project due to its practical relevance in the financial world. Understanding market volatility has direct applications for investment strategies and risk management, which can benefit both individual investors and financial institutions. The abundance of historical market data spanning multiple market cycles, including several major crashes and recoveries, provides us with rich material for analysis and pattern recognition.
    </p >
    <p>
      We are particularly drawn to the interdisciplinary nature of this project, which allows us to combine financial knowledge, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques. Recent market fluctuations due to global events have only heightened our interest, as they provide timely case studies for our analysis. Both Zhijun and Phoebe share a strong interest in financial markets and quantitative analysis, making this project a natural fit for our skills and academic goals.
